> ### To setup project (work both for production and development)  
  
- On terminal in `root directory` run (if `npm` was installed):  

    ```js
    npm run setup-project  
    ```

________________
> ### To run project (for both client and server simultaneously, for development)  

- On terminal in `root directory`, run (if `npm` was installed):  

    - On `windows`:
        ```js
        npm start
        ```

    - On `ubuntu`:
        ```js
        npm start-ubuntu
        ```

________________
## Run server only (production)

on terminal in `root directory`, run:  

For `windows`:  
```py
python manage.py runserver --insecure
```

For 'ubuntu':

```py
python3 manage.py runserver --insecure
```
Add `--insecure` because in `server/settings.py`, DEBUG=False


________________
> ### Run server and client separately or more details about setup and operate command

- Open package.jon and refer to scripts  


________________

> ### To add items as admin (`sequences`):  
- `Picture`, add image
- `Item`, add single-item
- `Selection`. selection of single-items
- `Dish`. dishes show on menu (user interface)  
- `Deals`, news and `Vouchers` for discount  

    Note: Many fields are duplicate when you try to add dish to menu. I still cannot optimize models structure.
